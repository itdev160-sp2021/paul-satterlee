    <h1>Cutting Down a Tree:  A Step by Step Guide</h1> 
    
    <h2><b>Step 1:  Find a Tree that needs to Die</b></h2> 
        <hr>  
        <p> By and large, trees are great.  However some are a nuisance to people, places and things.  These
        troubled trees are the ones you're going to want to cut down.  At this point, don't worry about 
        bombing a tree onto a house or a business, you're just going to want to kill this tree as fast 
        as possible.</p>
    <h2><b>Step 2:  Fire up your chainsaw</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Don't worry about people around you and if they have any ear protection.  Just fire that bad boy up and 
        tell everyone to get the hell out of your way.</p>
    <h2><b>Step 3: Just Start Cutting</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Just remember, it's everyone else's responsibility to watch out for you, not your responsibility
            to look out for them.  If someone wants to stand under a tree as it's falling to the ground, then 
            it was just their time.  
        </p>
